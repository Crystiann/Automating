NOTES:
A short program to automatically start a browser when computer starts and
after waiting 1.5 hours shutdown the computer. Great in the morning to
wake up and not pay attention to computer.

If you have password for windows go to search->netplwiz->uncheck 'Users must enter a user name and password to use this computer"->apply
->password
Now it will login without asking for password

print(pyautogui.position())  # use this to find the cursor position

For the file to start at computer start up pcreate a bat file that runs your script and place it(or a shortcut to the bat file) in the following location
'C:\Users\User\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup"
or
win+r and type shell:startup
Text for the bat file:
@echo off
python "E:\path to script\scriptName.py %"
pause  # the pause is optional, useful so that it keeps cmd open and trace errors and process

Important: go to gmail account -> settings -> security -> less secure app access and turn it on (it will not work otherwise)

If you have dual OS - win and ubuntu install grub-customizer from the ubuntu terminal
commands:
sudo apt-get-repository ppa:danielrichter2007/grub-customizer
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt install grub-customizer
open grub customizer -> select win and move it on first position(if you want o modify the time for starting OS go to Advanced settings-boot default entry after)
